# Frontend workshop

Let's learn how to consume a GraphQL API!

We will be using [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) with React for this workshop.

In this workshop you will touch on:

- Loading data
- Mutating data
- Updating the apollo-cache manually
- Using optimistic responses for better user experience
- Configuring the apollo-client with middleware
